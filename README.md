# Description

Recovering positional structured data from the following files:

- [Fill Colors used in the whole animation (except background gray)](data/Colors.csv)
- [Node Color & Positional Data](data/Nodes.csv)
  - [Node information of Triangle structures](data/Nodes.csv)
  - [Node information of Polygon structures](data/Polygon.csv)

Note that Polygons are formed out of three or more nodes whereas Triangles have a fill color and are only composed of three single nodes. The conjuction of these (Polygons & Triangles) construct the whole shape.

_Remember that you have to rename the directory to: `GraficacionPoligonos` in order to work with Processing. That is ONLY if someone ever intend to clone this repo._
